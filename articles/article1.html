      <h1>Alberta Oil Under Fire: Accusations of Government Protectionism and Suppressed Competition Spark Controversy</h1>
      <div class="article-meta">

        <p>The Alberta oil industry and government have come under fire recently as a growing number of activist groups, lobbyists, and environmentalists have come together to highlight what they argue to be unethical actions and regulations. Over the last few years, oilsands companies and the government have allegedly conspired to suppress competing industries and increase profit, all at the expense of the environment in the long term.</p>

        <p>Premier Danielle Smith responded, stating that the fossil fuel industry in the province is integral in supplying jobs. She claims that regulations and actions concerning the industry are primarily aimed at protecting incomes and ensuring affordability and reliability in the cost of living.</p>

        <h3>Alberta Hid Oilsands Environmental Violations for Years</h3>

        <p>Recently, an investigation by <a href="https://thenarwhal.ca/16-oilsands-companies-secret/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Narwhal</a> has revealed that at least 16 oilsands companies allegedly failed to pay fees for independent environmental monitoring. These regulations were a part of a <a href="https://open.alberta.ca/publications/joint-canada-alberta-implementation-plan-for-oil-sands-monitoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joint Canada-Alberta program</a> in 2012 to examine the overall environmental impact of oilsands development on the surrounding air, water, land, and biodiversity.</p>

        <p>The investigation found that, despite these violations, Alberta’s Environment and Protected Areas Ministry did not enforce penalties until several years later, while some were even written off. Furthermore, the government attempted to withhold the names of the companies involved, resulting in a three year legal battle ending with the release of the information in November of 2024.</p>

        <p>In an interview with environmentalist Richard Caldwell, he expressed concern with the government’s lack of accountability and its involvement in the protection of an industry that poses serious environmental risks. “It’s an important industry, I understand, however the government plays a key role in working alongside companies regarding environmental issues,” said Caldwell.</p>
        
        <p>Caldwell described the government's involvement in the fossil fuel industry as “not unlike the relationship between Polyphemus and Poseidon.” Just as Poseidon's vengeance delays Odysseus' journey home, Caldwell argues that the government's protection of oilsands companies hinders efforts to reduce environmental impacts.  He also points out that, like the gods supporting Odysseus, the control over regulation of the industry and the government can only be opposed with support of comparable power.</p>

        <h3>Alberta’s New Rules Make Renewable Energy Development Even Harder</h3>

        <p>Alberta has introduced a number of regulations that experts claim would suppress renewable energy development and competition to the fossil fuel industry. One such regulation is the <a href="https://www.desmog.com/2025/06/20/alberta-is-making-it-even-harder-to-develop-renewable-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code of Practice for Solar and Wind Renewable Energy Operations</a>, which makes it significantly more difficult and expensive to build solar and wind projects by imposing strict reclamation requirements and clean-up costs.</p>

        <p>Other regulations involve limiting where and how renewable energy projects can be built. Under <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-alberta-renewable-energy-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the new changes</a>, projects:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Cannot be built on important agricultural land or regions with “pristine viewscapes.”</li>
        <li>Must show that they can co-exist with existing farming infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Must include 35 km wide buffer zones from protected areas.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This, in conjunction with stricter end-of-life reclamation regulations, aims to minimize the impacts of renewable energy development in the province.</p>

        <p>These changes have faced significant backlash from critics who believe these regulations are not to benefit the environment, but rather the dominant oil industry. They argue that rather than encouraging sustainable development of renewable energy, these regulations would ultimately obstruct it.</p>

        <p>Certain activist groups express concern over the influence of the fossil fuel industry over the government and its regulations in the province. Recently, parts of a communication between Alberta Utilities Commission Chair Carolyn Dahl Rees and one of the largest oil companies in the province was leaked:</p>

        <blockquote>
        “Hear me, Poseidon, Sustainer of the Earth, god of the sable locks. If I am yours indeed and you claim me as your son, grant that Odysseus, sacker of cities and son of Laertes, may never reach his home in Ithaca.” [...] So Polyphemus prayed; and the god of the sable locks heard his prayer. (123-124)
        </blockquote>

        <p>Dahl Rees has officially stated that this was in regard to recent Trump tariffs and regulations that threaten the industry. However, many believe that it may be referring to competition from renewable energy development.</p>

        <h3>The “Odysseus vs. Poseidon” Movement</h3>

        <p>A recent movement was started online called the “Odysseus vs. Poseidon Movement”, which aims to bring an end to the growing influence of oil companies on government regulation. Members feel that the government and oil companies need to be held accountable for their actions and the consequences they have on the people of the province and the environment.</p>
