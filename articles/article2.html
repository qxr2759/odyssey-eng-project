      <h1>Tax Breaks Fuel Corporate Landlords, Worsen Housing Crisis, Experts Warn</h1>

        <p>Housing affordability continues to be a growing concern among Canadians, and experts warn that tax breaks are not helping the issue. Instead of helping lower housing prices, these tax breaks incentivise corporate landlords, reducing availability and raising housing prices.</p>

        <p>According to the group <a href="https://www.taxfairness.ca/en/media/releases/media-release-corporate-tax-breaks-worsening-housing-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Canadians for Tax Fairness</a>, rents rose by 8%, while wages increased just 5%. Additionally the real estate sector saw a massive $50.4 billion in profits, a 40% increase over pre-pandemic levels. They describe how the current tax structure treats housing units as an investment asset, rather than a basic necessity. The group urges the government to eliminate preferential tax treatment of real estate capital gains, and instead invest in building one million non‑market affordable homes.</p>

        <p>On November 7th, 2024, <a href="https://www.ndp.ca/news/end-tax-breaks-wealthy-corporate-landlords-says-ndp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the NDP also called for the removal of preferential tax treatment</a>. They blame wealthy landlords for rent-gouging Canadians and contributing to the housing crisis. They criticise the tax structure that allows corporate landlords to profit and push Canadians out of the housing market. A Parliamentary Budget Office estimates that closing the tax loophole could raise over $50 million per year, which the NDP claims could build at least 250 new affordable housing units annually.</p>

        <p>As housing prices surge, more and more Canadians point to the government’s inaction as they grow increasingly frustrated with a rising cost of living. “Pierre Poilievre may talk like he has solutions for the housing crisis, but the reality is, we’ve seen who he really works for—wealthy investors looking for another cash grab, not people living paycheque to paycheque,” said NDP critic Alexandre Boulerice. Indeed, a growing number of Canadians feel that the government works for corporate investors and wealthy landlords, rather than for individuals struggling with the cost of living.</p>

        <p>One such Canadian is Rachel Hiller, who lives in a corporate-owned apartment in Toronto. She says that she has given up on owning her own home, and that competing with wealthy investors in the housing market is like fighting a mythical hero who is destined to win. With the government seemingly supporting them, she compares corporate landlords to Odysseus, blessed with the gods’ support. “We fell thick and fast; and it was obvious that some god was on their side” (315), she states.</p>
        
        <p>We also talked to James Zhang, a 28-year-old Vancouver resident. He expresses frustration over wealthy landlords controlling the market and driving up the cost of living, as well as the government’s insufficient support. Describing his lack of control over his own circumstances, Zhang says, “But when the will of Zeus, Lord of the Aegis, stirred him, with Telemachus’ help he removed the excellent weapons they possessed and stowed them in the store-room and bolted the doors” (315).</p>
