        <p>In the 1990s, computers were a new and revolutionary concept to many people around the world. A country that had companies who were booming in this industry was the U.S. However, there was one company who really stood out among all of the emerging big technology companies, Microsoft. This company had so much power over the market of software and technology to the point where they ended up abusing it, causing one of the biggest antitrust cases in history.</p>

        <h3>The Rise of the Computer Powerhouse in the 90s</h3>

        <p>Microsoft was founded in 1975, by childhood friends Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Around the 1990s, Microsoft became much more popular in the technology industry as its operating system (Windows) became the global standard for computers. Since then Microsoft has made other digital products that many of you know of including Microsoft office and its own browser Internet Explorer (IE). Little did they know that this product would lead to many issues.</p>

        <h3>Allegations Arise</h3>

        <p>As the internet became more popular throughout the years, a market of web browsers formed. Of course Microsoft was part of this market with their browser IE. However another browser named Netscape Navigator was leading this market. According to <a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/01/msoft-goal-limit-netscape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wired</a>, Netscape had over 50% share of the market. This ended up posing a threat for Microsoft as they wanted their browser to be the dominating one in the market. To make sure this becomes the case, Microsoft took many measures. Consequently in 1998 the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Department of Justice</a> filed many claims against Microsoft including bundling IE with Windows so that consumers would feel less of an incentive to download Netscape Navigator since they already had one, discouraging PC producers to pre-install software that is in competition with IE by blackmailing them with certain contracts and making it restrictive so that the people who made PC’s had to oblige with Microsoft’s conditions. When interviewed one PC manufacturer had stated:</p>

        <blockquote>
          “You are hard-hearted, you gods, and unmatched for jealousy. You are outraged if a goddess sleeps openly with a man even if she has chosen him as her husband.” (66)
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Settlement After Court Hearing</h3>

        <p>During the trial, a lot of Technology Executives were involved, including Bill Gates, where his attempts at trying to save the company’s image did little to nothing. In 2000, Judge Thomas Jackson issued a ruling that Microsoft had indeed abused their monopoly power. For this they were told to separate into two entities (one for Windows and another for other software applications), which ended up not happening due to an appeal that overturned the ruling due to “procedural errors and bias during the first trial”. Instead they came up with this:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Sharing its APIs with third party developers</li>
            <li>Allowing PC manufacturers to install third party web browsers</li>
            <li>Having a technical committee auditing the company’s activities</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Justice For Calypso</h3>

        <p>Many companies and consumers feel as though it is society’s fault for giving such a corrupt company so much power over the entire market. “By letting them be part of most of our lives we give Microsoft the platform to do whatever benefits them, regardless of the external costs.” Not only that, but they didn’t experience much repercussions for their actions. So, a group of around 100 million people in the name of the Greek goddess Calypso (who also happened to face injustice due to power inequality) had emerged and started a movement to boycott Microsoft, making sure to not purchase PC’s that are using their operating system. This way it allowed for more companies to enter a market so that no single figure has full power over the rest.</p>
