        <p>If you are an avid shopper, you probably have noticed that many popular grocery stores such as Loblaws or George Weston seem much more expensive compared to No Frills or Food Basics. Recently it has come to light that this isn’t just a harmless trend, which is more expensive because of bad operations decisions, but rather the act of price fixing.</p>

        <h3>Evidence of Price Fixing Come to Light</h3>

        <p>From 2001 to 2015, Loblaws and George Weston, also known as the parent company to Loblaws, have been price fixing their bread, meaning that they have been artificially inflating the prices of packaged bread products throughout their stores. This meant that customers who were buying bread from these supermarkets were ultimately paying around $1.50 more than what they were supposed to for a loaf of bread.</p>

        <p>This revelation by the companies themselves was quite the shock to many as they have been relying on these retailers to give them food that is both good quality and fair priced.</p>

        <h3>Damage Control</h3>

        <p>In an attempt to “fix” their mistakes, Loblaws and George Weston started a program that gives customers a free $25 gift card in exchange for them to agree not to sue the companies in certain ways. Even with this “compensation” for the 14 years of overcharging, many critics stated that it doesn’t come close to making up for the cost that consumers had to bear. Some even stated that they felt as though it was (PR damage control), a strategy of which many corporations use to minimize the effects of a negative controversy or a crisis, rather than an actual restitution.</p>

        <h3>Desire for a Slice of the Prize</h3>

        <p>Another way that these big corporations are looking to atone for their actions is by giving settlement money to the citizens. In July of 2024, 500 million dollars was offered by George Weston and Loblaw. They make it so that most of the money is given through cash, while the other bit is given through store credit (gift cards). A lot of people who feel wronged by the price fixing of this bread are now happy about the fact that they get endorsed for most of the times they paid extra.</p>

        <p>However, under all of this chaos is a group of people who raise the concern of how worrying the context of this situation is. One ex-Loblaw Worker had stated that many of the people who were higher-up had conversations that showed signs of abuse of their corporate power, he even quoted the president of Loblaw of how he said:</p>

        <blockquote>
          "Father Zeus and you other blessed gods who live for ever, take vengeance on the followers of Odysseus son of Laertes. They have criminally killed my cattle, the cattle that gave me such joy every day as I climbed the starry sky and as I dropped down from heaven and sank once more to earth." (166)
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          “As for the culprits, I will soon strike their ship with a blinding bolt out on the wine-dark sea and smash it to pieces” (166-167)
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>Challenging Corporate Power</h3>

        <p>In recent findings, it was observed that more people struggle to adjust to inequality of power among citizens compared to mega corporations. This Loblaw situation shows how deceptive figures can be when they have more authority over you, in this case supplying a necessity to millions of people for a higher price just for self gain. Many people are starting to come together in the hopes of dwindling the amount of power these companies have. By bringing in more people who feel wronged by these corporations, they hope to limit the amount of control these companies have over them.</p>
