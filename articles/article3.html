        <p>If you are an avid shopper, you probably have noticed that many popular grocery stores such as Loblaws or George Weston seem much more expensive compared to No Frills or Food Basics. Recently it has come to light that this isn’t just some random trend you're noticing, but rather the act of price fixing.</p>

        <h3>Evidence of Price Fixing Comes to Light</h3>

        <p>From 2001 to 2015 Loblaws and George Weston(the parent company to Loblaws) have been price fixing their bread, meaning that they have been artificially inflating the prices of packaged bread products throughout their stores. This meant that customers who were buying bread from these supermarkets were ultimately paying around $1.50 more than what they were supposed to.</p>

        <p>This revelation by the companies themselves was a shock to many customers as they have been relying on these retailers to supply food that is both good quality and fair priced.</p>

        <h3>Damage Control</h3>

        <p>In an attempt to “fix” their mistakes, Loblaws and George Weston started a program that gives customers a free $25 gift card in exchange for them to agree not to sue the companies in certain ways. Even with this “compensation” for the 14 years of overcharging, many critics stated that it doesn’t come close to making up for the cost that consumers had to bear. Some even stated that this act was a PR damage control, which is a strategy of which many corporations use to minimize the effects of a negative controversy or a crisis, rather than an actual restitution.</p>

        <h3>Desire for a Slice of the Prize</h3>

        <p>Another way that these big corporations are looking to rectify their actions is by giving settlement money. In July of 2024, 500 million dollars was offered by George Weston and Loblaw. They make it so that most of the money is given through cash, while the other bit is given through store credit (gift cards). A lot of people who feel wronged by the price fixing of this bread are now happy about the fact that they get endorsed for most of the times they paid extra. To know more about this please visit <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/loblaw-bread-fixing-payout-1.7544627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CBC</a> where they will let you know how you could be compensated for the years of paying extra.</p>

        <p>However, under all of this chaos is a group of people who raise the concern of how worrying the context of this situation is. A former Loblaw employee revealed that many senior executives engaged in conversations that suggested an abuse of corporate power. He even quoted the president of Loblaw saying:</p>

        <blockquote>
          "Father Zeus and you other blessed gods who live for ever, take vengeance on the followers of Odysseus son of Laertes. They have criminally killed my cattle, the cattle that gave me such joy every day as I climbed the starry sky and as I dropped down from heaven and sank once more to earth." (166)
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          “As for the culprits, I will soon strike their ship with a blinding bolt out on the wine-dark sea and smash it to pieces” (166-167)
        </blockquote>
        
        <h3>Challenging Corporate Power</h3>

        <p>In recent findings, it was observed that most people struggle adjusting to the inequality of power between the citizens and mega corporations. This Loblaw situation exemplifies how deceptive figures can be when they have more authority over you, in this case supplying a necessity to millions of people for a higher price just for self gain. It is important to be mindful of these things. Maybe it doesn’t make much of a difference in your life, but it certainly does for somebody who is barely scraping by with the money they have. If more people become aware of corporate corruption, companies engaging in such practices will feel less motivated to treat their customers poorly.</p>
