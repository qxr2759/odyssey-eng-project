    <section class="about-intro">
      <p>The Daily Homer was created by Leo Chen and Anishan Sivakumaran with the goal of bringing to light important issues in society. When it comes to issues that affect everyone, effective and widespread communication, access to information, and education are essential in driving change.</p>

      <p>At its foundation, we are driven by the issue of disproportionate power of governments and corporations, and the negative effects they have on society overall in their pursuit of profit and self-gain. We are inspired by Homer’s The Odyssey, in which the unbelievable influence of the Greek gods drives the story forward and is a significant aspect of the story. We aim to juxtapose these mythological aspects with reality to effectively illuminate the issues of today.</p>

      <p>Homer blends an omniscient third-person perspective to give an objective description, and first-person storytelling, which allows for a more emotional and subjective viewpoint. We aim to provide a similarly balanced portrayal of pertinent issues, striving for a factual illustration of the most significant issues of today while also showcasing the impact on real people through first-person testimonials.</p>
